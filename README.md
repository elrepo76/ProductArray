This is a simple console application in .NET 6.0 that does 2 things:

1. Given an array arr[] of n integers, constructs a Product Array prod[] (of same size) such that prod[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of arr[] except arr[i]. It is solved without division operator.

2. Given an array arr[] of n integers, calculates the product of the 2 biggest values in the array, and the product of the 2 smallest values in the array.
