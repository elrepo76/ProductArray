This is a simple console application that does 2 things:
1. Given an array arr[] of n integers, construct a Product Array prod[] (of same size) such that prod[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of arr[] except arr[i]. Solve it without division operator.

2. Given an array arr[] of n integers, it calculates the product of the 2 biggest values in the array, and the product of the 2 smallest values in the array.
